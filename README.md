# Synacor Challenge

## Code 1: Architecture spec
The first code is listed in architecture spec document so no code is needed.

## Code 2: Boot
After implementing the first three instructions (0, 19, 21) as mentioned in the architecture spec, the VM yields the
second code.

## Code 3: Self-test
After implementing the remaining instructions the VM passes the self-test and yields the third code.

## Code 4: Tablet
Picking up and using tablet in the first location yields the fourth code.

## Code 5: Twisty passages
Exploring the map yields the fifth code

## Code 6: Ruins
After obtaining can of oil for the lantern, I've been able to navigate through the darkness. I've arrived to a strange
monument which read the following:

```
_ + _ * _^2 + _^3 - _ = 399
```

In addition to that, the adjacent rooms contained some coins. The coins have markings indicating their value (2,3,5,7,9)
and using them on a monument completes the equation. The trick is just to insert them in the correct order so that the
equation makes sense.

After the door is unlocked I find a teleporter device which yields the sixth code when used.
